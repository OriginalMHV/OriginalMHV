### Hey there, and a warm welcome to my profile! 👋

### 📙 About me

I'm Michael, your friendly neighborhood developer with a positive and proactive approach to everything I do. I have a passion for software development and love finding creative solutions to complex challenges. As a team player, I greatly value open communication and collaboration. I work diligently to ensure that the solutions I develop are not only functional but also perfectly meet the team's needs.

Currently, I'm working as a developer at Telenor in the beautiful region of Akershus, Norway. Here, I get to explore every aspect of the development process, from ideation and design to testing and implementation. Every day is filled with exciting tasks like coding, configuring, debugging, and brainstorming new ideas. I love that no day is the same as the last, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills.
